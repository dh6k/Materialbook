    🍴 About this fork
</h2>

This is a fork of [eepiemi/Materialbook](https://github.com/eepiemi/Materialbook) maintained by [dh6k](https://github.com/dh6k).
All credit for the original app — idea, design, and the bulk of the code — belongs to eepiemi.

Fork-only changes (on top of upstream v1.0.0):
* Open Messenger links directly in the Messenger app, with a configurable package name in settings
* New "Open Messenger" item at the top of Materialbook Settings
* Harden adblock with structural signals, catch obfuscated Sponsored + paid-partnership labels
* Rebranded application ID (`vip.dh6k.materialbook_fork`) so it installs alongside the original

    🤖 AI disclosure
</h2>

To be fully transparent: **the fork-only changes above were written with heavy AI assistance.**
An AI coding assistant (Muse Spark, via an agentic harness) implemented the Messenger integration,
the adblock hardening, the rebrand, and this README — iteratively, with the maintainer testing
each change on a real device and directing every decision. The upstream codebase it builds on is
100% human-made by eepiemi and contributors. AI-written code was reviewed by building, installing,
and exercising it on-device before each commit — but expect AI-shaped rough edges, and please
[file an issue](https://github.com/dh6k/Materialbook/issues/new/choose) if you find any.
